# What are Emerging Tech Workshops?

Emerging Tech Workshops (ETW) is series of workshops that will give you a chance to get experience with our security and compliance solutions and present the value of these products in the context of security and compliance challenges that a typical organisation faces.

The workshop will use a set of scenario-based challenges which will cover the journey from risk identification to mitigation and value delivery and leave you with knowledge that you will be able to translate to your own work environment.

These challenges are not step-by-step labs, but provide scenario-driven requirements that attendees work collaboratively to solve. The attendee squads are not alone in implementing the requirements, as the workshop coaches work with each team to provide guidance and help along the way. 

Environment: These workshops can be hosted virtually over Teams or in-person (for larger audience)

# Typical team size:
Attendees work in teams of 5 to 10 people to solve a series of challenges.

# Workshops Available:

## Security Workshop
This workshop enables participants to implement recommended security best-practices by working through challenges inspired from real-world scenarios. 

By the end of the workshop, participants will gain hands-on knowledge on how to assess security setup for an organisation architect against required policies and regulations. They will also go through the process of architecting and implementing policies to mitigate any threats discovered during the assessment.
5-6 participants in each team

## Entra Permissions Management

Access governance for cloud environments is a key focus area for a lot of organisations. Due to complexity of cloud IAM and lack of visibility around permissions usage, cloud identities become high-value target for attackers. 
 
This workshop leverages challenges inspired from real-world scenarios to enable your team on Entra Permissions Management (EPM), a CIEM solution that provides visibility and control over cloud permissions and help minimize over-provisioning of access. 
 
By the end of the workshop, participants will gain knowledge on how to discover and mitigate permissions gap in their cloud infrastructure, and align their security redesign initiative with Zero Trust framework by implementing Least Privilege

## Defender IoT

Visibility and security of OT/IoT infrastructure is a key area of concerns for many industries. 

This workshop leverages challenges inspired from real-world scenarios to enable your team on using Microsoft Defender for IoT agentless network detection and response (NDR) capability to gain comprehensive security across your IoT/OT infrastructure. 

By the end of the workshop, participants will gain knowledge on how to rapidly deploy Defender IoT suite across a IoT / OT landscape and utilise it to provide solve some common business problems and secure an OT environment.

## Threat Intelligence (TI) and External Attack Surface Management (EASM)

Many businesses have internet-facing assets they may not be aware of or have simply forgotten about. These are often created by shadow IT, mergers, and acquisitions, incomplete cataloguing, business partnersâ€™ exposure, or simply rapid business growth. 
 
This workshop leverages challenges inspired from real-world scenarios to enable your team on Defender Threat Intelligence and External Attack Surface Management, a pair of solutions that map the internet every day, providing security teams with the necessary information to understand adversaries and their attack techniques.

By the end of the workshop, participants will gain knowledge on how to discover and investigate threats from external exposure, perform threat hunting and intelligence gathering, and deploy customised and relevant cyber threat intelligence to Sentinel.
