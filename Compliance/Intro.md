# Compliance Workshop

## Workshop Structure
This workshop is made up of a series of challenges. Each challenge has a description which follows the storyline of a hypothetical organisation called Contoso Mortgage. Your team will tackle these challenges as a team. We will identify a leader for each challenge who will help the team achieve the listed Success Criteria before moving to next one.

For each challenge, your team will present the objective, approach, and outcome to the CISO and describe how each can be used to protect or manage the organization’s security and compliance requirements.

## Completing a challenge
* Go through the scenario described in the challenge and understand the success criteria.
* Explain the key requirements of the challenge to all the participants
* Go through the required security and compliance tools to take necessary steps for the challenge and collect required information.
* Summary and discuss your findings and how they can be used to mitigate risk or enhance Contoso’s identity posture.
Your coach will discuss your findings before you move on to the next challenge
While going through this experience, kindly note to:
* Resist the initial temptation to rush to the keyboard! Take time to pause and think as a team about the challenge, what is expected, and how to optimize the team member skills to achieve success.
* Use a new Edge profile for demo environment, to avoid any confusion with any other credentials that you may use to access Azure or Microsoft 365.
 
## Microsoft Purview Risk and Compliance 
Microsoft Purview risk and compliance solutions help you manage and monitor your data, protect information, minimize compliance risks, and meet regulatory requirements.

Your information protection strategy should be driven by your business needs, but every organization has a requirement to protect some or all of its data. Use the capabilities from Microsoft Purview Information Protection to help you discover, classify, protect, and govern sensitive information wherever it lives or travels.
Know your data

You have information residing across all the Microsoft 365 services and on-premises. Identifying which items are sensitive and gaining visibility into how they're being used is central to your information protection practice. Microsoft Purview includes:
* Sensitive information types to identify sensitive items by using built-in or custom regular expressions, or a function.
* Trainable classifiers to identify sensitive items by using examples of the data you're interested in rather than identifying elements in the item.
* Data classification provides a graphical identification of items in your organization that have a sensitivity label, a retention label, or have been classified and the actions your users are taking on them

### Protect your data
There are many capabilities that you can use from the Microsoft Purview Information Protection solution to help protect your data, wherever it's stored and however it's accessed. However, sensitivity labels are the foundational capability that both provide protection actions and interact with other Purview solutions and capabilities.

Sensitivity labels provide users and admins with visibility into the sensitivity of the data that they're using, and the labels themselves can apply protection actions that include encryption, access restrictions, and visual markings. For more information about the range of labeling scenarios supported, see the Common scenarios for sensitivity labels section from the getting started documentation. 

### Prevent data loss
Unintentional sharing of sensitive items can cause financial harm to your organization and may result in a violation of laws and regulations. Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention can help protect your organization against unintentional or accidental sharing of sensitive information both inside and outside of your organization. In a data loss prevention policy, you:
* Define the sensitive information you want to monitor for, like financial, health, medical, and privacy data.
* Where to monitor, like Microsoft 365 services or Windows and macOS devices.
* The conditions that must be matched for a policy to be applied to an item, like items containing credit card, driver's license, or social security numbers.
* The actions to take when a match is found, like audit, block the activity, and block the activity with override.

### Manage your data lifecycle
Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management provides you with tools and capabilities to retain and delete content across Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Microsoft 365 Groups, Teams, and Yammer. Retaining and deleting emails, documents, and messages are often needed for compliance and regulatory requirements. However, deleting content that no longer has business value also reduces your attack surface.

## Microsoft Priva
Privacy is top of mind for organizations and consumers today, and concerns about how private data is handled are steadily increasing. Regulations and laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) impact people around the world, setting rules for how organizations store personal data and giving people rights to manage personal data collected by an organization.

To meet regulatory requirements and build customer trust, organizations need to take a "privacy by default" stance. Rather than manual processes and a patchwork of tools, organizations need a comprehensive solution to address common challenges such as:
* Protecting the increasing amounts of unstructured data from privacy issues arising from human error
* Helping employees adopt sound data handling practices and training them to spot and fix issues
* Understanding the potential risks in the amount and type of personal data they store and share
* Fulfilling data subject requests, or subject rights requests, efficiently and on-time

Microsoft Priva helps you meet these challenges so you can achieve your privacy goals.
