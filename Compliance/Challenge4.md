# Challenge 4: Monitor PII data overexpose & User training

## Objective: Ensure company value data has been kept within the department

## Detail
It has come to the CDPO’s notice that users are not following the best practices for handling personal data. Users have files with PII in their OneDrives and on SharePoint and these files are being shared far and wide both internally and externally. Your organisation conducts regular privacy trainings but the users tend to forget. The CDPO wants to educate the users on the best practices of handling personal data by providing them feedback and point in time trainings. You also want to enable admins to be able to take action on items if the users don’t.

## Success Criteria
1. Create a Priva policy
1. Review matched items and take action
1. Review user digest email
