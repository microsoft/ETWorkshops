# Organisation Setup
Contoso Mortgage has expanded their business to Asia, and they need to compliance to certain data protection and privacy regulations. Thatâ€™s why they hired a Chief Data Protection Officer, David Bob, to outline the data protection strategy.  

The company is interested in protecting its customer privacy and sensitive data from potential loss due to malicious or inadvertent activities. David has done the current preliminary risk assessment of the company and outlined few challenges they need to address to meet the regulatory requirements. 

This exercise will take us through the experience of defining the problem statement, identifying, and evaluating Microsoft Information Protection and Privacy Management capability, and presenting the solution to the Chief Data Protection Officer and senior leadership team.
