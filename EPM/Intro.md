# Organisation Setup

Contoso Mortgage has a hybrid setup with a lot of their workloads hosted in Azure. They use Azure AD as their primary Identity Provider (IDP). 

The company is interested in protecting its intellectual property from potential loss due to malicious or inadvertent activities. Their cyber team has identified gaps in their User Access Review process which led to identities having unnecessary permissions which may result in loss of valuable information. They want to position this risk and a potential solution to their CISO.

This exercise will take us through the experience of defining the problem statement, identifying, and evaluating CIEM capability, and presenting the solution to the CISO and senior leadership team.
