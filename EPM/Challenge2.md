# Challenge 2: How deep does the rabbit hole goes?

## Objective: Investigate and Present Key Statistics

Your initial proposal to the CISO has hit a nerve and wants you to explore the risk further. He has an upcoming budgeting conversation where he will present the key investments and business benefits. If this risk is worth looking into, he will make it a part of his conversation. 

To help your CISO with some data points, she would like you to conduct a deeper assessment of the onboarded subscription. Your investigation must highlight the key risk areas along with representative risky candidates for each category. This will help the CISO with building a case for investment in this area.

As part of this challenge, you will look at the reports and analytics produced from the onboarding and highlight the key areas your investigation should focus on. You will also look at manual investigation experience and look at different ways of viewing the results of the risk evaluation.

Once you have identified the information to focus on, put it in the attached summary presentation template. Your CISO will use the template for his budgeting meeting next week.

## Success Criteria
* As a representation of the case to be presented back to your CISO, identify the following:
  *	Identify the permissions of ____X____ user and explain how they are assigned these permissions
  *	Which IAM related activities did ___Y___ perform recently?
  *	How many people have access to ___Z___ resource, but arenâ€™t using it?
*	Find the top 3 security groups with over-provisioned access and list them down for remediation
*	Find the number and percentage of identities that are inactive, and find top candidates for remediation
*	As a policy, all admin access is always provisioned via group membership. However, one of the admins was provisioned with direct access. Identify the admin and tag the permission for remediation.
*	Update the template attached in the appendix to be presented to the CISO with the findings
